# Jiak Simi 
"Jiak Simi" is a mobile app designed to address these challenges by providing a platform for friends to share genuine food recommendations. Users can easily add and edit reviews for dishes theyâ€™ve tried at different restaurants. Reviews include the dish name, its picture, price, rating, and any comments or tips. The app features a "search by cuisines" page, allowing users to filter dishes according to their preferred cuisine or find inspiration for what to eat next.

## Approach
* Plan user stories and features of the app (e.g. being mobile-friendly since users will most likely be using it on the go)
* Create wireframe, ERD, workflow diagram and Figjam (to keep track of tasks)
* Set up frontend and backend repositories
* Code including testing and debugging, followed by polishing of the UI
* Deploy

## Product Design Documentations
* [Figjam + ERD](https://www.figma.com/board/0eadeDavnWvkIEU9P9e1Yu/ga-seif-project-3?node-id=87-618&t=8FLO0bAMzABYc7Xd-0)

## Key Challenges/takeaways
* Using the right methods and parameters for CRUD operations using Mongoose
* Try to ensure all pull requests are approved first, and communicate to see which files each other are working on before making new changes to reduce the chances of a merge conflict.
* Try to create utility functions that can be re-used to increase efficiency of coding process and readibility of code


## Next Steps
* Add Google API in the Food Card page to render map, addresses, links to more reviews 
* Enhance form validation rules (e.g. required fields)
* Allow user to delete their reviews and accounts
